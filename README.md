> referenced from the **[Humber course outline](https://humber.ca/transferoptions/course-outlines/outline.html?code=HTTP%205114&view=1&year=2024)**  
> This course will allow students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assessment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support. 

> [!WARNING] 
> To avoid academic misconduct, no assignments, labs, or anything containing gradeable code will be made public on this repo.
